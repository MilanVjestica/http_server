# http_server
Custom HTTP server created with python sockets

This is library/framework for creating your own HTTP server, creating your own paths, rendering templates with jinja, file handling ... You can see how structure needs to be in '/paths' folder. You should put every file for your website in that folder and then link them in HTML file.

To run the demo you need to install requirements.txt and import website.sql database to you SQL server. After that just run python run_website.py and you should be good to go. 

Default host is 127.0.0.1 and port is 80 so you need to run it as sudo or administrator.
